# RHAMT/Windup Analysis
A Github Action that will execute a [RHAMT](https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhamt/overview) analysis to your repository.

> Red Hat Application Migration Toolkit is an assembly of open source tools that enables large-scale application migrations and modernizations. The tooling consists of multiple individual components that provide support for each phase of a migration process. The migrations supported include application platform upgrades, migrations to a cloud-native deployment environment, and also migrations from several commercial products to the Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform.
